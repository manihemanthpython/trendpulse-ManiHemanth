The Project

TrendPulse is a 4-part pipeline you'll build one task at a time:

Task 1      →    Task 2      →    Task 3       →    Task 4

Fetch JSON       Clean CSV        NumPy/Pandas      Visualise

Start here. Each task uses the output of the previous one.

What to Build

HackerNews has a free, fully open API that returns trending stories as JSON — no login, no key, no sign-up needed.

You will fetch trending stories and group them into 5 categories: technology, worldnews, sports, science, entertainment

Assign a category to each story by checking whether its title contains any of these keywords:

Category	Keywords to match (case-insensitive)

technology	AI, software, tech, code, computer, data, cloud, API, GPU, LLM

worldnews	war, government, country, president, election, climate, attack, global

sports	NFL, NBA, FIFA, sport, game, team, player, league, championship

science	research, study, space, physics, biology, discovery, NASA, genome

entertainment	movie, film, music, Netflix, game, book, show, award, streaming

Step 1 — Get the list of top story IDs:

https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json

This returns a JSON array of story IDs (integers). Fetch the first 500.

Step 2 — Get each story's details:

https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{id}.json

This returns a single story object.

Add this header to your requests:

headers = {"User-Agent": "TrendPulse/1.0"}

Tasks

1 — Make the API Calls (8 marks)

Use the requests library to fetch the top story IDs, then fetch each story's details

If a request fails, print a message and move on — don't crash the script

Wait 2 seconds between each category (time.sleep(2)) — one sleep per category loop, not per individual story fetch

2 — Extract the Fields (7 marks)

From each story, save these fields:


Field	HackerNews field	Description

post_id	id	Unique ID of the story

title	title	Story title

category	(your category)	The category you assigned based on keywords

score	score	Number of upvotes

num_comments	descendants	Number of comments

author	by	Username of the story author

collected_at	(add yourself)	The current date and time

Collect up to 25 stories per category (125 total).


3 — Save to a JSON File (5 marks)

Create a folder called data/ if it doesn't exist

Save all stories to a file like data/trends_20240115.json

Print how many stories were collected in total

Expected Output

After running your script, you should have:

A file at data/trends_YYYYMMDD.json
At least 100 stories inside it
A console message like: Collected 122 stories. Saved to data/trends_20240115.json


Submission Checklist

 Script runs without errors

 JSON file saved in data/ folder

 At least 100 stories collected

 Each story has all 7 required fields

 Code is commented

Marks Breakdown

2	Extract required fields	7

3	Save to JSON file	5

Total	20

Next: Task 2 will load this JSON file, clean it, and save it as a CSV.
